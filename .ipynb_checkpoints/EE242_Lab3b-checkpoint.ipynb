    "## Assignment 3 -- Analyzing frequency content of a signal\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will use a discrete Fourier transform (specifically, the Python implementation of an FFT) to analyze the frequency content of the 100ms segment of the horn signal (from 200ms to 300ms) from assignment 3A. Because this is a periodic signal, the frequency content will have spikes, but because it is a discrete-time signal, they will have finite height. You will experiment with different FFT sizes and different plotting options. The description below assumes that you import numpy as np.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A.** Use the np.fft.fft function to compute the FFT for the 100 ms horn signal, with an fft size of nfft=1024, which you can call **x_f**. Recall that the result of the FFT will be a vector that spans frequencies [0,$f_s$]. If this is a real-valued signal, then the first half of the FFT matters: [0,nfft/2]. **x_f** is not returned in the desired order so in order to get both the positive and negative frequencies, you need to use the np.fft.fftshift function to get **x_f2**. Create two different plots of the magnitude of result using **(np.abs(.))** in a 2x1 view: one with positive and negative frequencies and one with just positive frequencies. Be sure to scale the magnitude according to time signal window length $f_s$ and signal duration. Label the frequency axis in terms of Hz by creating a vector **freq** that scales the FFT index by $f_s$/nfft. \n",
    "\n",
    "**B.** It is often the case that frequency content is plotted on a log scale. Plot the one-sided (positive frequency) magnitude using using a log scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C.**  Changing the size of the FFT will change the frequency resolution, but it also changes the shape of the result a bit. Just as we saw with Gibbs phenomenon where increasing the number of Fourier series coefficients gave a high frequency ringing at sharp edges, increasing the FFT window will give a “ringing” effect for sharp peaks in frequency. To see this effect, compute the FFT using nfft=2048 and plot the log magnitude only using positive frequencies. Compare to your plot from Part B. The effect is easier to see on a log scale. "
